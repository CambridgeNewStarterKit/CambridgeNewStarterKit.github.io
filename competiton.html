			Which College should I choose?
			</h3>
			<p>
			Choosing a Cambridge College is tricky if you can't take the time to visit every one of them. Here we have aimed to include some crucial information one each of the 31 colleges, including location, images, information on accommodation and food.
			<!--if we don't have time use pictures of colleges as links to college websites-->

			<!--start with something like: colleges divide the huge student body of uniofcam (=how big?) into smaller chunks, making it easier for everyone to meet people, find friends and get support that they need. Colleges are separated into JCR, MCR and SCR, which are student bodies as well as actual rooms. Say what they stand for (junior, middle (?), senior). college vary in athmosphere and architecture, some very modern, others very old.-->

			<!--This is a comment. Eventually it would be nice to have several tabs across the top. On the main page have some pretty pictures and a paragraph explaining the website. 
			1) tab on colleges 
			2) tab on necesscities/top tips ("things you may not have thought about, bike, where to buy cutlery(poundland, wilkinsons), gowns...")  
			3) Tab as an exchange website, can post what you need (bike/formal tickets etc).  
			4) Useful links: different societies? where to get help if you need it? Best places to eat in Cambridge? explain what camsis/camtools/raven etc is, sightseeing?-->
